# Flappy Bird Unity Game Project ðŸŽ®

This is a **Flappy Bird**-inspired game built using **Unity**. The goal of the game is to control a bird that needs to navigate through a series of moving pipes without colliding with them. The player controls the bird's vertical movement by tapping or pressing the space bar to make it "flap" upward, while gravity pulls it downward.

## Features:
- Simple and intuitive **gameplay mechanics** inspired by the classic Flappy Bird.
- Randomly generated pipe obstacles that move from right to left, increasing the challenge.
- A basic **score system** that tracks how many pipes the player has successfully passed.
- Responsive controls for desktop (space bar) and mobile (tap).
- **Smooth 2D physics** with dynamic bird movement based on Rigidbody2D components.
- A minimalistic art style with the potential for future expansion (adding sound effects, UI elements, etc.).

## How to Play:
- Press the **space bar** (or tap on mobile devices) to make the bird flap upward.
- Avoid hitting the pipes and the ground.
- Each pipe passed earns a point. Try to beat your high score!

## Project Overview:
This repository contains the full Unity project, including:
- **Bird movement script** for handling flight and gravity.
- **Pipe spawning script** for generating obstacles with random heights.
- **Pipe movement script** for continuous horizontal scrolling.
- **Basic game loop** for starting, restarting, and handling collisions.

## Technologies Used:
- **Unity 2D** game engine for game development.
- **C#** for game logic and physics management.
- **Git** for version control and collaboration.
